This project incorporates three parts to control a simulated car
1. Part One- Drag Race
In this part you'll write code that lets a car jump over a grove of trees. This might not be a common scenario for a self driving car but it will get you familiar with the programming interface.
2. Part Two- Circular Track
You'll write code that lets a car navigate a circular track. In doing so you'll explore the relationship between steering angle and turning radius.
3. Part Three- Parallel Park:
In this part you'll write a sequence of instructions that successfully parallel parks a car.
